                                Encouraging larger orders is key to maximizing revenue in the manufacturing industry. With manufacturing ezyfind&apos;s volume-based pricing options, you can incentivize clients to place bigger orders by offering them discounted rates based on order quantity.

                                Here&apos;s how it works: When a client places an order above a specified threshold (e.g., 100 units), they become eligible for volume-based discounts. These discounts could be tiered so that the more they order, the greater their savings. By implementing this pricing strategy, you not only motivate clients to increase their order size but also benefit from economies of scale in your own manufacturing processes.
